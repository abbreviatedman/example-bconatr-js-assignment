# Example bconatr.js Assignment

An example assignment using the [bconatr.js](https://github.com/abbreviatedman/bconatr-js) library.

### Usage

1.  Open the `index.html` in a browser, or run a live server for automatic updating. You can run the [NPM live-server package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) or use a text editor extension, like [VS Code's Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
2.  Open the dev tools console to see the running tests.
3.  Try breaking the code in `logic.js` to make tests fail.
4.  Add new tests in `tests/logic.tests.js` to explore that process.
